# ðŸ˜œ Meme generator

## About this project

In order to review some basic concepts of Vanilla Javascript (such as DOM manipulation, events and conditionals) I created this fun meme editor.

## Features

By using this program, the user will be able to:

- Add an image using a URL
- Add color and filters to the image
- Add top and bottom text
- Configure the color, size and style of the text

The project is not finished yet. I'm still working on the meme download function and the responsive styles.
